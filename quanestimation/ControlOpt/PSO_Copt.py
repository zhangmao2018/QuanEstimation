        If set `True` then the control coefficients and the values of the
        objective function obtained in all episodes will be saved during
        the training. If set `False` the control coefficients in the final
        episode and the values of the objective function in all episodes
        will be saved.

    > **p_num:** `int`
        -- The number of particles.

    > **ctrl0:** `list of arrays`
        -- Initial guesses of control coefficients.

    > **max_episode:** `int or list`
        -- If it is an integer, for example max_episode=1000, it means the
        program will continuously run 1000 episodes. However, if it is an
        array, for example max_episode=[1000,100], the program will run
        1000 episodes in total but replace control coefficients of all
        the particles with global best every 100 episodes.

    > **c0:** `float`
        -- The damping factor that assists convergence, also known as inertia weight.

    > **c1:** `float`
        -- The exploitation weight that attracts the particle to its best previous
        position, also known as cognitive learning factor.

    > **c2:** `float`
        -- The exploitation weight that attracts the particle to the best position
        in the neighborhood, also known as social learning factor.

    > **seed:** `int`
        -- Random seed.

    > **eps:** `float`
        -- Machine epsilon.

    > **load:** `bool`
        -- Whether or not to load control coefficients in the current location.
        If set `True` then the program will load control coefficients from
        "controls.csv" file in the current location and use it as the initial
        control coefficients.
